        <h2>📝 Work History</h2>

        <h3>Teller at Business Division Bank Hapoalim</h3>
        <p>
          The job required a very high level of service and responsibility
          I needed to be creative, independent and productive while working in a distributed work environment
          Very high attention to details and precision
          I gained experience of working with big companies (The electricity company, the gas company, BAZAN and many more) both directly and indirectly
          The position also helped me develop great time management and organization skills
